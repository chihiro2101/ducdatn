Congress has been dismayingly inconsistent in its voting on gun-control legislation this year, first passing the Brady Bill, then moving in the opposite direction by defeating a provision to ban certain assault weapons and ammunition.
But in one respect members of Congress are consistent: they demand respect for our "constitutional right to own a gun.
" They cite the Constitution's Second Amendment and argue it prohibits effective national regulation of the private ownership of guns.
But there are strong grounds for arguing that the Second Amendment is no barrier to gun-control legislation.
In my opinion, it even provides a solid constitutional basis for effective national legislation to regulate guns and gun owners.
The best clues to the meaning of the key words and phrases are in debates in the First Congress of the United States.
A constitutional amendment calling for the prohibition of standing armies in time of peace was proposed by six state ratifying conventions.
Virginia's version, later copied by New York and North Carolina, brought together three elements in one article -- affirmation of a right to bear arms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standing army:
In the version of the arms amendment he presented, Madison dropped mention of a standing army and added a conscientious objector clause.
"A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms."
Well, for example, it means that Congress has the constitutional power to enact a Militia Act of 1992, to require every person who owns a gun or aspires to own one to "enroll" in the militia.

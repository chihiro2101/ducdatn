Elizabeth Taylor is breathing with the assistance of a ventilator after undergoing surgery aimed at determining the cause of pneumonia that has kept her hospitalized for three weeks, her physicians said Monday.
The Academy Award-winning actress was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica last week for treatment of the pneumonia, and was listed in serious condition in the hospital's intensive-care unit on Monday, her doctors said in a prepared statement.
Lisa del Favero, a New York City publicist for Taylor, said the actress is "seriously ill, but she's not on her deathbed.
Del Favero said Taylor's four children -- Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding -- were with her at the hospital.
Taking a biopsy on the actress is called Sutton's law in medicine, after legendary holdup man Willie (the Actor) Sutton who said he robbed banks "because that's where the money is," said Dr. John G. Mohler, a pulmonary disease specialist at the USC School of Medicine.

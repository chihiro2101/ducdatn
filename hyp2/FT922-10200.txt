Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed by the scale of the violence.
Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowds looted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.
The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday, the first night of rioting, against sending in National Guard troops, and only to have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable of handling the violence.
But the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removal under a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and Mr Gates has developed political clout on top of this job security.

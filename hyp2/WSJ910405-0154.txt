The brutal beating of Rodney Glen King by Los Angeles policemen offers convincing evidence that a code of silence exists within that department, but it also illustrates a similar reluctance of the nation's police chiefs to criticize a fellow chief.
Four officers took turns kicking and beating an unresisting victim for more than two minutes.
These criminals in uniform would not have dared their brutality had they feared that any of the 17 other police officers watching would report their criminal actions.
Blatant racist jokes and comments about the beating on the police communications system make it hard to believe that this was an "aberration" as Chief Daryl Gates claims.
The culture of the department that allowed the brutalizing of Rodney Glen King was created under Mr. Gates's leadership.
Yet we, his fellow police chiefs, have for years remained silent about Mr. Gates, who yesterday was put on a 60-day leave by the Los Angeles Police Commission.
Through the years Mr. Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the new concept of community policing, in which officers work with citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime.
A few years ago Chief Gates referred to gang members as "dirty little cowards," and warned them that "there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer.
Similarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps Program backed by other police chiefs.
Mr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals.
Many chiefs openly disagreed with Mr. Gates when he opposed the Police Corps Bill in Congress.

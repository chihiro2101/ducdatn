Terry D. Barnes, 24, was shot between the eyes in his apartment.
Police said an officer investigating a report of a prowler had entered the apartment at 3:30 a.m. and fired after Barnes got out of bed to see what was wrong.
It was the seventh shooting death involving Kansas City police officers this year.
Where do you draw the line?'' said roommate Andy Brez, 23, who was sleeping in another bedroom when police entered on Saturday.
Barnes was white, as is the officer who shot him; however, other recent incidents of alleged excessive force involved black citizens.
An officer encountered Barnes, unarmed, in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, standing in his bedroom, police spokesman Sgt.
Police Chief Steven Bishop said before the latest slaying that the department's standing has fallen in the community, and a ``behavior modification'' program is being developed for offending officers.

A CEO sneezes in his corporate suite.
At the other end of the building, half an hour later, a janitor pauses in his work and yawns.
The next day, the janitor is sick with the same flu the CEO had.
Along with oxygen, they may be getting flu and other infectious bugs from their co-workers.
The evidence comes from various studies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only be explained by poor air ventilation.
"Modern office buildings are tight," says Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California's occupational health program.
But, alas, many modern ventilation systems recirculate indoor air with little or no fresh air.
People are the source," says Dr. Edward Nardell, who studies airborne infections for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
The study found that 40 percent of the building's workers -- or 27 of 47 -- were infected with tuberculosis from one 30-year-old sick employee.

Most black leaders (as distinct from rank-and-file blacks) are supporters, at least in public, of the gun control -- really, prohibition -- movement.
Do they realize that America's gun-control movement sprouted from the soil of Roger B. Taney, the racist chief justice who wrote the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857?
In the early part of the 19th century, Dred Scott, a black slave, had been taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave state, to Illinois, a free state.
From there he was taken into the Wisconsin territory, free territory above the 36 30' latitude of the Missouri Compromise.
After living in free territory for a while, he returned with his owner to Missouri.
When his owner died in 1846, Scott sued in the state courts of Missouri for his freedom, on the ground that he had lived in free territory.
Scott appealed to the federal courts, since the person he was actually suing, John Sanford, the executor of the estate that owned Scott, lived in New York.
That black people, whether free or slave, were not citizens of the U.S.; therefore, they had no standing in court.

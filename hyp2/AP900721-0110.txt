Cloudy weather Saturday threatened to mar the show for thousands of Finnish and foreign skygazers hoping to glimpse a total solar eclipse in this land of the midnight sun.
The weather forecast took a turn for the worse in the evening, when the Finnish Meteorological Services predicted cloudy weather with a chance of showers for eastern Finland on Sunday.
In the eastern town of Joensuu, a television news broadcast late Saturday showed it was already cloudy there with a light drizzle falling.
The solar eclipse in Finland starts at 4:03 a.m. Sunday (9:03 p.m. EDT Saturday).
The eclipse will be total in an arc about 125 miles wide from the northern Baltic Sea and southeast Finland, across the Kola Peninsula and northeast Soviet Union, to the Aleutian Islands near Alaska.

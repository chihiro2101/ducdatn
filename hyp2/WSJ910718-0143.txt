L. Gordon Crovitz quotes Alexander Hamilton in "Lawmakers Sue for Their Jobs --
Another Reason for Term Limits" (Rule of Law, June 19) to note that legislators sometimes take themselves too seriously.
But is it true, as Mr. Crovitz implies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?
Federalists Hamilton and James Madison had some experience with term limits.

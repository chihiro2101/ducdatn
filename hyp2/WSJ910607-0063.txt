You think it would be utter folly to lend money to a Third World nation?
So, how about a Third World vegetable stand?
U.S. development organizations are finding that some of the world's poorest entrepreneurs repay their debts at rates approaching 100%.
To encourage grass-roots private business in Latin America, Asia and Africa, these organizations are expanding programs that already lend thousands of these struggling entrepreneurs amounts ranging from $50 to several hundred dollars.
Tiny Third World businesses commonly repay these "microloans" faithfully because they crave the security of a favorable credit rating.
This rescues them from the clutches of loan sharks -- microloans typically charge the prevailing local commercial loan rate -- and lets them borrow again in hard times.
The money helps them start or expand their businesses -- selling vegetables, sewing, repairing shoes, making furniture and the like -- and boosts their local economies.
It also looks good compared with a default rate of 17% by U.S. recipients of federally guaranteed student loans.
With the decline of communism, U.S. development groups believe they are exporting free-market economics to tiny businesses that can fuel growth in the developing world.
Accion's Ms. Romanow says the group, which serves Latin America, plans to expand the lending to a total of between $500 million and $1 billion over the next five years.

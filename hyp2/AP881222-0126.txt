A U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight.
The Pentagon said the pilot might have ejected safely.
It was the second crash of a Thunderbolt jet in Europe in two weeks.
The Air Force later corrected that statement, saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury.
Howard said the plane ``crashed at 9:53 a.m. EST about four miles south of St. Ives, or about 25 miles north of Cambridge.''

In the aftermath of Ben Johnson admitting to his steroid use, many US track and field officials and athletes said Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash.
Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his involvement with illegal performance-
enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome.
He was tested after his world-record run there, but the results were negative.
The possibility that Johnson could lose his record was raised when the International Amateur Athletic Federation asked for "legal opinion" to see what to do about records of confessed drug users.

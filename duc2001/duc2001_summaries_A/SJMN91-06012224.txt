In the 50-meter dash at the Hamilton Spectator Games Friday, the first race after his two-year suspension for drug use, Ben Johnson proved he can run fast without the prohibited anabolic steroid that caused his expulsion.
However, he only managed to finish second behind Darn Council of Florida.
The race produced a record crowd of 17,050 and drew nearly 500 journalists from 14 countries.
His time of 5.77 seconds to Council's 5.75 was far from the 5.55 he ran in 1987 that is still the fastest ever.
Johnson was given a thunderous standing ovation before and after the race.

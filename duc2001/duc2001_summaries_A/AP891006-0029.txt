Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter who lost his Olympic gold medal after testing positive for steroids, said that it is wrong for athletes to use muscle-building substances.
Johnson spoke to reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as a controlled substance was introduced Thursday.
He was invited to appear by three Congressmen who were presenting the legislation.
Carl Lewis also attended the news conference because he was working on his autobiography and one of his chapters deals with steroids.
Representative Mel Levine (D-Calif) referred to the abuse of steroids as "the silent side of the drug disease in this country."

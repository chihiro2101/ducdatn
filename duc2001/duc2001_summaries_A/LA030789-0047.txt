Carl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just after their 100-meter final at the Seoul Olympics.
Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson's drug test, which turned out positive.
A Canadian sprint coach testified at a Canadian inquiry that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer before a urine analysis.
Accordingly, an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer provided to facilitate urine samples.
Lewis' attorney said the allocation was ludicrous.
Lewis called for Johnson to be a role model like himself and to tell kids to stay off drugs.

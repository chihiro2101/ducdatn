Canadian Ben Johnson, accused of cheating with drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash, left the Olympics stripped of his gold medal.
He was also suspended from international competition for two years and banned from Canada's national team for life.
Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used the illegal and dangerous anabolic steroid called stanzolol, and one noted that "steroids is nothing anymore."
Johnson appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not able to speak as he made his way back to Toronto.
The prize went to American Carl Lewis, who did not gloat over his rival's fall.

Tetsuya Theodore Fujita is an American professor of geophysical science.
He is one of the world's foremost authorities on violent storms.
He discovered that most tornadoes are actually six or seven small twisters called suction vortices, rotating around the center of a larger tornado.
He developed a 1 to 5 scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes.
However, his best work may be on other air movements called downbursts and microbursts.
It is believed these phenomena have been the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the past 15 years.
His work helped persuade the FAA to install new radars at major airports.

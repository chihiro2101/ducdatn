Ben Johnson returned to Canada without the Olympic gold medal, dodging reporters and the public and refusing to talk about the illegal steroid found in his system after he won the 100-meter dash as the world's fastest human.
On the flight from South Korea, he denied using the drugs although Olympic officials said the results were indisputable.
Canada's Sports Minister said Johnson tested negative for drugs in August and passed eight tests in two years.
Johnson's family, friends, and personal physician denied he took steroids.
Hundreds rallied to his side in Toronto but his fans in Montreal said they were disappointed.

California officials have condemned a U.S. Senate vote to exclude illegal aliens from the census.
They fear that California will be shortchanged by millions of dollars in federal aid for programs for poor people.
California is thought to have at least 50% of the nation's 3 to 8 million illegal aliens.
The Senate bill is expected to face tough opposition in the House where states with large alien population such as California, New York and Illinois have many votes.
Furthermore, a federal court in Pittsburgh ruled earlier that excluding illegal aliens from the census would be unconstitutional.

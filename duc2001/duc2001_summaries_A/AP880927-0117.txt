Canadians were shamed, angry, and saddened that national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold medal after a urine sample showed traces of anabolic steroids.
Johnson had won the 100-meter dash in a record-breaking 9.79 seconds.
The medal went to American Carl Lewis who finished second.
Canada's Sports Minister said his government accepted the validity of the tests.
He acknowledged that it was suggested to him several months ago that Johnson might be using steroids.
It was a second shock to national sports fans after hockey legend Wayne Gretsky was traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings.

Fellow Canadian Olympic sprinter Angella Issajenko was quoted as saying in a published interview that Ben Johnson knowingly took steroids.
She also said that Johnson, stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after testing positive for stanzolol, was also taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last summer in Rome.
Ms. Issajenko said she also took the muscle-building drugs and claimed that Dr. Jamie Astaphan provided the steroids to her and Johnson with the knowledge of their track coach.
The federal government has appointed an official to head a judicial inquiry into the Johnson affair.

The stripping of Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medal after he won the 100 meters Saturday in 9.79 seconds, shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretsky.
He was stripped of the medal Tuesday when he tested positive for stanzolol, a steroid outlawed by Olympic officials.
Sports columnists heralded his unheroic conduct as "Fools Gold", "From Fame to Shame", and "Big Ben is Now Has Been", calling the episode a tragedy of epic proportions.
However, one columnist said the nation should not cover its head in shame noting that after all, "it is also just a foot race."

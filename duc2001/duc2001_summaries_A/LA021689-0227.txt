Ben Johnson's personal physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, has said that the disgraced sprinter took the banned steroid stanzolol on one occasion four months before the Seoul Olympics last year.
Astaphan said Johnson suffered "violent muscle spasms" after taking it and that he nursed him back to top condition.
Astaphan also said that Johnson was not on stanzolol when he beat Lewis for the 100 meters gold and denied he ever prescribed such drugs to Johnson or other athletes.
Johnson has said he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs.
An inquiry into drug use in amateur sports resumes hearing next Wednesday in Toronto.

Lynda Huey, who was at the Seoul Olympics working for NBC-TV and as a physical therapist, said that Canadian coach Charlie Francis bragged about Ben Johnson's preparation for a show- down against sprinter Carl Lewis.
Accordingly, Francis, who had claimed that Johnson's urine sample at the Olympics was spiked with a banned steroid, told Ms. Huey before the race that Johnson was "more afraid of failing the drug test than he is of Carl Lewis."
Huey said at a drug use inquiry she had known Francis since 1980
and she was tired of hearing him
say Johnson was clean at the Olympics.

Charlie Francis, the Canadian National Sprint Coach, testifying in Toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs, made it plain that he had given the athletes every steroid combination imaginable, his experiments carefully calibrated and analyzed.
His system worked well until his most famous pupil, Ben Johnson, tested positive for illegal steroid use at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 and lost his gold medal.
In his own confessional "Speed Trap", Francis argues that steroids must be used to be a world-class sprinter.
They make runners train
harder not run harder, their use is rampant, and too prevalent to be banned.

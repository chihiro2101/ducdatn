The Senate has voted to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens despite arguments from the Bush Administration it is both unconstitutional and unworkable.
Senators in favor of counting aliens said that a ban is impractical because the Census Bureau forms have been printed and they do not contain a question about legal status.
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-NY, said that all residents have been counted for 190 years.
If that is changed, he said it would destroy confidence in the census results.
Mario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund said the shocking decision of the Senate would discourage people in the Hispanic community from participating.

Nature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse of the sun, one that'll be among the longest this century.
And the best viewing spots are virtually in California's back yard:
The Big Island of Hawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.
Unfortunately, you can probably forget about seeing it, because, unless you get lucky, you can't get there from here anymore.
With some people having booked trips as long as three years in advance, airline seats, rental cars and hotel reservations range from difficult to impossible to get, travel agents and others report.
"The closer you get to the event, the less there is" available, said Paul Kloetzel, president of O'Brien Travel Service in San Jose.
If clouds don't spoil the show, viewers along that path will see the moon slip slowly in front of the sun.
The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds -- at the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico's west coast.
Bob Bruynesteyn, head of the San Mateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: "Not too many people have stood in the shadow of the moon."
An eight-page brochure on the July 11 eclipse is available for $2 from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 390 Ashton Ave., San Francisco, CA 94112.

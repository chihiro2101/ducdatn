In his first race after a two-year suspension for drug use, Ben Johnson proved Friday night that he can run fast even without the anabolic steroid that caused his expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
But the 29-year-old Canadian, whose indoor and outdoor world records were washed away by admissions that he used performance-enhancing substances for seven years, managed only to finish second in the 50-meter dash of the Hamilton Spectator Games.
His time of 5.77 seconds was eclipsed by the 5.75-second time of Daron Council, a former narcotics officer who now works in crime prevention for the Alachua County, Fla., sheriff's department.
The brief race produced a record crowd of 17,050 and drew nearly 500 journalists from 14 countries in North America, Europe and Asia.
Johnson got off to an uncharacteristically slow start and finished second by a few inches to Council.

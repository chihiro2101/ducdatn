A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a ventilator, doctors say.
Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the pneumonia.
She was in the intensive care unit at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said.

If the two sides trying to force changes in the 1990 census both get their way, the results would nearly balance one another, a population expert said Wednesday.
The Census Bureau is under pressure to exclude illegal aliens from its national head count.
``If both sides get their way, the only change would be a flip-flop of one seat from California to Georgia,'' said William O'Hare, director of policy studies for the independent Population Reference Bureau.
The only change, he said, would be that California would gain five new seats instead of six, while Georgia would add two rather than just one.

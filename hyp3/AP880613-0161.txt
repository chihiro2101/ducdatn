Police captured the top military leader of the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.
Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the Andean highlands in May 1980.
``Osman Morote is considered the No. 2 of the party and its military chief,''
Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said Morote was arrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along with two women.
Morote, known within the rebel band as ``Comrade Remigio,'' is second in importance only to Guzman, who founded the Shining Path as a splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party.

William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University and a hurricane forecasting specialist, said he uncovered a strong association between seasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intense hurricanes.
In July he said there would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which six would be hurricanes.
The National Hurricane Center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.
Mr. Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newest of five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane activity.

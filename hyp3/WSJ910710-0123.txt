As federal army tanks and jets pounded the breakaway republic of Slovenia last week, the pin-striped brokers of the Ljubljana Stock Exchange defied air-raid dangers and gathered in their sixth-floor trading room.
It was one of their best days ever.
Bonds issued by the besieged republic traded briskly and climbed to records.
The price of vouchers to obtain foreign exchange jumped 10%, even though Slovene banks had stopped issuing foreign currency.
"There is a certain logic to this," says Drasko Veselinovic, the exchange's chief executive.
The two million people of this picturesque Alpine republic are waking up from their two-week nightmare sobered by the implications of their intoxicating declaration of secession from Yugoslavia on June 25.
Their bravado is undiminished, reflected in the almost unanimous feeling that there can be no going back now that blood has been spilled in defense of independence.
But there is also a growing unease about going forward, because no one knows where Slovenia is headed.
Their considerable trade with the rest of Yugoslavia, which helped make them the country's richest people, is vanishing.
Almost every country on the continent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the Soviet Baltics to French Corsica, that could be encouraged by the independence declarations of Slovenia and the neighboring republic of Croatia.

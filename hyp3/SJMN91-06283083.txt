For months, this county's politically astute Sheriff Sherman Block maintained a low profile for himself and his department while city police were being hammered after the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.
But then sheriff's deputies shot four people dead in the space of one month.
The corruption case of an elite drug unit continued to make headlines.
The spotlight that had been trained on the police department and its 8,300 officers now has widened to take in the equally large sheriff's department.
Block's measured response to the criticism -- and the lack of a riveting videotape -- have spared him the level of heat felt by Police Chief Daryl Gates.
"We are a multiracial, multicultural city more than any other," said Ramona Ripston, head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.
Joseph McNamara, retired chief of San Jose's department and now a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said he has been getting calls all summer from cities around the country about racism and brutality in their departments.
"There isn't the level of interest among voting people, people with power, people with influence," ACLU spokesman Joe Hicks said.
"Police brutality (or) racism is not a social problem, it's a law enforcement lack of leadership," the Hoover Institution's McNamara said.

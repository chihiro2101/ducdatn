Some 160km west of Tokyo in Japan's coastal Tokai region is what may be the world's most dense array of geophysical instruments.
More than 150 meters and gauges track seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal movements and ground water levels.
The data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock in the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment's notice, will recognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake.
If the committee so advises, Japan's prime minister will issue an earthquake warning for the Tokai area.
Trains will be stopped, traffic routed out of the area, stores closed and pupils let out of schools.
Long after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting earthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year monitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general earthquake prediction research.
But for increasingly vocal sceptics in Japan, it is at best a misguided effort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading the public.
Despite the protests, however, Japan's earthquake prediction programme rolls along on inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.
Japan has had numerous killer quakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.
Kiyoo Mogi, chairman of the six-member panel that will make the call on the Tokai earthquake and former head of the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute, says several factors make the Tokai region more suited than others for what he calls 'a national experiment'.

Pentagon and Air Force officials said regular training flight schedules resumed Thursday at noon local time (5 a.m. EDT).
A.C. Roper, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in Saudi Arabia.
He said Air Force officials wanted to ``examine potential hazards and to be sure they were doing everything possible to prevent accidents.
Williams said the Air Force gave its pilots in the gulf ``safety awareness'' briefings during the flight ban in order ``to review what they need to do to fly more safely.''
Williams said the Air Force was the only service that has taken special measures to review safety in the gulf since this week's accidents.

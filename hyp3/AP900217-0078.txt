At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists said.
``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing remission,'' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDS epidemic may be coming to an end.
``There's new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible,'' said John McGowan of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
Sten Vermund, also of the Allergy Institute, noted that an epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in AIDS patients in the inner cities.

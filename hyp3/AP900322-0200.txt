``Mad cow disease'' has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted.
``I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,'' says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. `
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986.
The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.
The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement.
As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE.

Carl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just after their 100-meter final last fall at the Seoul Olympics.
"He got out of those blocks like a caged lion," Lewis said in an interview Sunday at the Los Angeles Marathon, where he was representing a sponsor.
"I said, 'Look, I don't know what he is taking or what he is doing, but he is doing something.' "
According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to facilitate them in providing urine samples.
Francis said that two witnesses told him that the stranger had spoken with Lewis in another area of the waiting room.
"These sound like the last acts of desperate men who know they've committed wrong and see no other way out other than to continue to lie and to fabricate stories.
He set the record at the 1987 World Championships at Rome, where Lewis finished second in 9.93 seconds.
Lewis said Sunday that officials of the International Amateur Athletics Federation should disallow Johnson's world record from Rome because Francis has testified his sprinter took drugs before the World Championships.
Lewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are beginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry.
But Lewis defended Evelyn Ashford, a world-class sprinter who was implicated as a steroid user in Francis' testimony last week.
Lewis and Ashford are teammates on the Santa Monica Track Club.
I don't think that will hurt her image because Evelyn is clean and she always stood for being clean.
Even before Lewis replaced Johnson as the gold-medal winner two days after the race, the U.S. Olympian said he was happy with his result.
But it made me feel like I'm putting something back into track and field because I'm setting an example."

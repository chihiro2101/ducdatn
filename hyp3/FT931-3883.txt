Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, yesterday repeated the official advice that beef can be eaten safely: 'There is no scientific evidence of a causal link between BSE in cattle and CJD in humans.'
One cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise, in spite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence of cases would peak last year and then decline rapidly.
It was revealed this week that Mr Peter Warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in 1989, died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.
Dr Robert Will of Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, who is monitoring all CJD cases in the UK for the Department of Health, drew attention to Mr Warhurst's case without naming him in the Lancet, a medical journal.

The answer may decide the men's winner of Monday's Boston Marathon.
Can Ingrid Kristiansen and Joan Benoit Samuelson, the two fastest women's marathoners in history, return to their past glory after having their second babies or is a wave of runners ready to sweep past them?
Along the historic route that begins in Hopkinton, west of Boston, and ends in Copley Square in the Back Bay section of the city, checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate.
For example, all 11 checkpoint records were shattered through the first 20 miles last year, either by Simon Robert Naali or Juma Ikangaa, both of Tanzania.
Foremost among them are Kristiansen, the 35-year-old Norwegian who holds the world record of 2:21:06 and won in Boston in 1986 and 1989, and Samuelson, 33, the U.S.-record holder at 2:21:21, 1984 Olympic gold medalist and Boston champion in 1979 and 1983.

As Congress goes back into session today, the gulf between legislators and the American people has never been greater.
A recent Gallup survey found that 70% of House Members oppose the idea of limiting the number of congressional terms, while the public backed the idea two to one.
CBS poll has found that Members of Congress may be the only demographic group in the country that doesn't favor limits on terms.
The rest of the country is frustrated with a legislature where the turnover is about that of the non-elected British House of Lords.
The idea of limiting terms is overwhelmingly popular with Americans regardless of party, ideology or income.
Martin Plissner, political director for CBS News, says he has "never seen an issue on which there was so little demographic variation.
In the past three elections, 96% or more of House incumbents who ran won.
One out of four House districts this year likely will have an incumbent running with no major-party opposition -- up from one out of five in 1988.
That's why the Washington, D.C.-based Americans to Limit Congressional Terms is asking states to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms.

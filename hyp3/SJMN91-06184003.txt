President Bush on Monday nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative Republican with a controversial record on civil rights, to replace retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.
If confirmed, the 43-year-old judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would follow Marshall as the second black to ascend to the court.
But Thomas, who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap conservatism, would present a striking change from Marshall, a civil-rights pioneer and an anchor of the court's declining liberal faction.
Thomas, barely half the age of the man whose seat he was named to fill, came of age in the world that Marshall helped create.
Now the question is to what extent Thomas would add weight to the court's new majority that appears willing to dismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build.
While not much is known about Thomas' views on most issues likely to come before the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and to policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.
In his year as a federal appeals court judge, he has not ruled on affirmative action, but he has long been outspoken in taking the position that government affirmative-action programs are not only unwise but unconstitutional.
His views on other major issues before the court, including abortion, church-state relations and the definition of constitutional due process, are unknown.
Thomas' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990 confirmation hearing for his seat on the Court of Appeals was widely viewed on Capitol Hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a Supreme Court nomination.
Now that President Bush has nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, the next step is up to the Senate.

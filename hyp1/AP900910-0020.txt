Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of the nation's farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched crops and livestock.
But the 1988 drought wasn't as bad as it might have been, according to an Agriculture Department analysis.
Crop yields plummeted, but commodity prices rose.
For those who eked out some production, or had grain stored from previous years, it wasn't too bad.
The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought's effects was written by Gerald W. Whittaker of the department's Economic Research Service.
It concentrated on the most severe drought region, centered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains.
_Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an average of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987.
The nine states studied as the ``drought region'' were Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

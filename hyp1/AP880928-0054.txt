Ben Johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion, without the Olympic gold medal and the hero's welcome, as Canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test.
Returning to Canada on Tuesday, Johnson, 26, dodged reporters and the public, refusing to talk about the muscle-building and illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system after he won the 100-meter dash as the world's fastest human.
But on the flight from South Korea, he denied using the drugs even though Olympic officials said the results were indisputable.
Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for Canada. `
Stripped of the gold and banned for life from Canadian teams, Johnson cried in the back of a limousine that whisked him to his mother's home in suburban Toronto after the grueling trip from Seoul.
``There's no gold now, just disappointment,'' said Boyd Plaxton, 26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, one of 200 people on hand when Johnson's plane landed.
Johnson, surrounded by a phalanx of security guards, ducked into a car and made a mad dash for the door when he arrived at the house.
On the way to New York, however, he stayed in the passenger cabin, appearing calm throughout the flight, the Globe said.
I know it,'' said his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth, Jamaica, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail.

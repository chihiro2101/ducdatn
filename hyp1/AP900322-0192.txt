A stone's throw from the smelly Smithfield meat market is an office building complex with no sign or anything to attract the attention of Londoners hurrying by.
Mounted cameras, jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the uninvited.
This is the Central Selling Organization, London-based marketing arm of the De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa.
Its experts sort mounds of rough diamonds constituting 80 percent of the world's annual production.
Sales have declined sharply, and the 56-year-old cartel is facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to sell more of their own gems.
Although its prosperity and control of the world diamond industry looks unchallengeable, the pressures could loosen its grip and crimp its profits.
``This year is going to be a critical one for De Beers,'' says Diamond Intelligence Briefs, a trade publication.
De Beers' South African interests face an uncertain future, largely because of a newly energized political will by the black majority in that country, an important diamond producer.
Jack Lunzer, managing director of IDC Ltd., an independent diamond distributor in London, said De Beers undoubtedly will continue to control the major part of world production, but its marketing arm's profits will fall.
The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines, which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and the Soviet Union.
Formally known as De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and based in Kimberley, South Africa, the company was formed in 1888 by the British industrial colonialist Cecil Rhodes.

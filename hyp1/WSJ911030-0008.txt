The mood in the House majority leader's conference room darkened with each passing moment as leading Democratic congressmen heard one of their party's most prominent pollsters report what the public thought about them.
The ostensible purpose of the recent session with Peter Hart was to discuss the public mood on campaign finance reform.
Mr. Hart and a Republican cohort, Douglas Bailey, conducted six focus groups in July in three states -- Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts -- to get a deeper feeling of public opinion.
But as Mr. Hart summarized their findings, the discussion quickly centered on the dismay and disgust many voters feel about politics and government these days.
The Hart-Bailey report found the public "downbeat" about the way the country is going, convinced that Washington politicians are "more concerned with political self-preservation" than with the public good.
But a few days after the election, political analyst Alan Baron offered a revelation: For the first time since World War II the average re-election margin of House incumbents from both parties declined from the previous election.
Term limits would accomplish few of their proponents' goals -- more-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and would result in many unintended consequences-far more power accruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists.
More important, lawmakers ought to overhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make congressional elections more competitive, and to reduce the role of money and influence peddlers in campaigns.
The case is well articulated by two of the most experienced congressional observers: Richard Fenno, a University of Rochester political scientist and author of numerous books on Congress, and Charles Ferris, an attorney who served as chief counsel to both former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill.

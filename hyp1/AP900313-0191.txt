From a helicopter, the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never touched it.
Silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow, and smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald eagle perched in a shoreside spruce.
But the view doesn't impress Joe Bridgman of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
The pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole turns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million gallons spilled into Prince William Sound last March 24 by the tanker Exxon Valdez.
A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings like the oil under this Perry Island beach.
But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the oil spilled, state officials estimate.
But that may take up to 70 years for some hard-hit seabird colonies, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service researchers say.
Exxon distributes before-and-after pictures of cleaned beaches; Bridgman and other state officials, accusing Exxon of ``myth-making,'' eagerly make room for journalists on flights to oiled beaches.

Patience is often difficult to muster for those who run the 26.2 miles of a marathon.
The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and get a head start on recovering from it.
Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men's and women's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners.
Rex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself out, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 seconds, a course record.
Wen Yanmin, a 23-year-old student from Bejing, China, picked her way through a strung-out pack and out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2:43:33, also a course record.
Run as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of teams from invited countries.
Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach Marathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each.
Viktor Gural of the Soviet Union, who had been among the leaders for most of the race, said he had trouble with everything.
Two Soviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in third and fourth place throughout the race, faded.

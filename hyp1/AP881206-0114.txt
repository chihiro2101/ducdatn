A B-52 bomber crashed and burst into flames early today on a runway while practicing ``touch-and-go'' landings at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, officials said.
All eight crew members survived.
The plane, normally equipped to carry nuclear bombs, crashed about 1:15 a.m., said Lt. Naomi Siegal, a spokeswoman at the Strategic Air Command installation.
The crew was practicing landings after a seven-hour training flight when it crashed during one of its touch-and-go approaches, Peck said.
All three sections of the plane burned on impact, said Senior Airman Tim Sanders, a base spokesman.
1st Lt. Daniel McCarrick, 25, an electronic warfare officer from Succasunna, N.J.; Airman 1st Class, Joseph A. Vallie, 20, a gunner from Stephenson, Mich.; Maj.
In other accidents involving B-52s, a bomber was damaged when a pilot aborted a takeoff and overshot a runway at Castle Air Force Base in central California on Feb. 11.
Six crewmen died and 10 were injured Oct. 11 when an Air Force tanker en route from K.I. Sawyer crashed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base near Oscoda.

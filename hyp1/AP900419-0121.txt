Actress Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said.
We have nothing else,'' said Lisa Del Favaro, a Taylor spokeswoman with Chen Sam and Associates public relations in New York City.
Miss Taylor, 58, hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, was transferred to St. John's on Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.
``She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain hospitalized,'' Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist treating Miss Taylor, said in a statement Tuesday.

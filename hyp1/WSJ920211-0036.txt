For example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12 Counterpoint, "Gun Control Is Constitutional," felt compelled to instruct me that the word militia means "the whole people," a point I quoted three times and also paraphrased once in my brief article.
I said that although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private uses of arms, there is an unenumerated but undeniable right to own a gun.
One letter writer who also knows something about the Constitution, though disagreeing with me on another point, agreed on the central issue, that regulation of gun ownership and use does not violate the Constitution.
Requiring gun owners to register with the National Guard would provide the kind of scrutiny the Brady and Staggers bills contemplated, and, if Congress dared, could provide an additional measure of control over who owns what kinds of weapons.

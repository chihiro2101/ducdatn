Hispanics, whose incidence of diabetes is two to three times as high as the population of the United States as a whole, can learn how to manage the illness at a free half-day clinic Saturday at St. Louise Health Center in Morgan Hill.
Heredity and diet appear to be the major reasons that 14 to 21 percent of Hispanics -- and up to 40 percent in the 64 to 75 age group -- contract diabetes, said Rochelle McNamara, executive director of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara Valley.
Hispanics who have strong American Indian ancestry may be vulnerable to diabetes because about 50 percent of all Indians develop diabetes, McNamara said.
The diabetes management program for Hispanics will be from 9 a.m. to noon at St. Louise Health Center, 18500 St. Louise Drive, off Cochrane Road in Morgan Hill.

On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who were told that the war against the Shining Path ("Sendero Luminoso") guerrillas had almost been won.
Lucky punches sometimes win wars, and maybe this was the case.
The police had discovered the house in one of Lima's affluent neighborhoods just two days earlier.
This was the underground organization's central nervous system, commented investigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short man who is a consummate bureaucratic survivor.
Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to put Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.
Alas, as it turned out this was not the rebel organization's headquarters, nor its central nervous system, but more of an archive and memorabilia repository.
As Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's next president on July 28, the question of whether the Shining Path will hound his administration as it has the previous two ranks high among his concerns.
Among Shining Path watchers ("Senderlogos") there is strong disagreement on fundamentals:
The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru was holding general elections after 12 years of a military dictatorship.
Midpoint during his term, Mr. Garcia lost all hope of defeating the Shining Path, and decided just to coexist with it, says Rafael Merino, a respected analyst on security matters.
According to Francisco Loayza, Mr. Fujimori's adviser on internal-security matters, military actions against the Shining Path should be subordinated to economic-development initiatives.

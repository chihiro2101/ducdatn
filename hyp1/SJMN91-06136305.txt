You can have your tamale and eat it too, says Rachel Torres, diabetes educator at San Jose Hospital and coordinator of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara Valley's Hispanic Education Program.
The secret to eating Mexican and other Hispanic foods while still maintaining a healthy diet is in the preparation of the food, she said.
Beginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be offering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort to educate them on the dangers of diabetes.
For those who can't make it to class, the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara County offers the bilingual booklet, "Comer Bien Para Vivir Mejor," a seven-day Mexican food menu for diabetics as well as those who want to eat healthy.

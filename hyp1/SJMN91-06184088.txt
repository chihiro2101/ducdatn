Senate Democrats promised today to scrutinize Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas' views on abortion and other divisive issues.
"I'm satisfied that this man will pass muster," President Bush declared Monday in naming Thomas to succeed retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall.
Conservatives applauded the selection and predicted liberals would have trouble opposing the black judge.
"The failure to give an answer may cause me and others to be unwilling to vote for his confirmation," Metzenbaum said on "CBS This Morning."
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that Metzenbaum did not press Justice David Souter during confirmation hearings about his position on abortion.
"I will not support yet another Reagan-Bush Supreme Court nominee who remains silent on a woman's right to choose, and then ascends to the court to weaken that right," said Metzenbaum, the only member of the Judiciary Committee who voted against Thomas' nomination to the Circuit Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said on NBC's "Today" show that "literally nobody nominated for the Supreme Court should give his or her views with regard to cases that might come up in the future."
But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said "in the past few months alone the Supreme Court is throwing out past decisions, and I think it is legitimate to ask Judge Thomas
"The background of Judge Clarence Thomas is less important than his views and what they mean to protecting our constitutional rights," said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.

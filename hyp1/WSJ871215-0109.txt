How much more of an "investment" should American taxpayers make in the welfare system?
This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987.
The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.
The bill's questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency.
This thinking was nicely summarized by Rep. Anthony Beilenson, who said plainly, "The truth is, for welfare reform to be successful, it's got to be expensive."
In short, the Family Welfare Reform Act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo.
It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency.

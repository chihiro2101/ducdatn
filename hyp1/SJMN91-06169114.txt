HURRICANES ARE part of the romance of the tropics.
The great storms have made fictional plots of B movies and unmade real dreams of people who would implant civilization in an environment that could be swallowed up by nature in a moment.
A hurricane ended the dream of a railroad down the Florida Keys in 1935 and virtually isolated Key West for two years.
The last to hit Miami was Cleo, a small one, in 1964, and the intervening period of calm defies all odds.
From now until the end of the season, the six hurricane specialists will monitor weather computers 24 hours a day.
People who venture into such dubious endeavors as long-term hurricane forecasting said this could be another light year.
NO MATTER what long-range forecasters say, scientists at the Hurricane Center know that the laws of probability are closing in on Miami.
"Historically, south Florida has had more hurricanes than any other site," said Jerry Jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeing Miami's 27-year hiatus nervously.
At the center, scientists built a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane were to hit Miami today.

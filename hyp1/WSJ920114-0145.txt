In his "Gun Control Is Constitutional" (Counterpoint, op-ed page, Dec. 12), the American Enterprise Institute's Robert A. Goldwin's principal concern, it seems, is to deny that the right to keep and bear arms precludes the power to regulate gun ownership and use.
Even activities protected by the First Amendment may be regulated when they threaten the rights of others.
But Mr. Goldwin also writes that "The right to bear arms protected in the Second Amendment has to do directly with `a well-regulated militia'"; thus, arguably, he continues, "if you want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard."
This would condition the "right" to keep and bear arms on joining the National Guard.
The Second Amendment, in its language and its history, makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms.
Yet Mr. Goldwin treats it as a necessary condition, which enables him to conclude that Congress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if he did not join the National Guard.
Mr. Goldwin makes this mistake, in turn, because he has misread Madison's original version of the Second Amendment, which exempted conscientious objectors from military service.
Thus he says that "In this version, `bearing arms' must mean `to render military service,' or why else would there have to be an exemption for religious reasons?
Yet Mr. Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says, "that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia."
Let those who want guns join the National Guard, says Mr. Goldwin.

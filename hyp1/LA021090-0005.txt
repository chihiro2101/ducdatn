Around the world, national theologies are crumbling: communism, apartheid and, here in America, the worship of guns -- to foreigners, the single craziest thing about us.
Do you sense an outbreak of sanity about gun control?
There was retired Chief Justice Warren Burger preaching sacrilege on the cover of Parade magazine a couple of weeks ago.
Unfortunately, there is the Second Amendment to the Constitution: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."
Since the amendment's stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it creates no individual right to own a gun.
The purpose of the First Amendment's free-speech guarantee was pretty clearly to protect political discourse.
But liberals reject the notion that free speech is therefore limited to political topics, even broadly defined.
A colleague says that if liberals interpreted the Second Amendment the way they interpret the rest of the Bill of Rights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory.

Britain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials reported.
Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the ``Chunnel'' - the Channel Tunnel - confirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British workers sent the probe through to French colleagues.
``It is an example of what Europe is about,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in London. `
The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802, who thought he could defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a land passage.
``This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect, that Britain is no longer an island,'' said a construction union official.
The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of drilling on the world's costliest tunnel.
The meeting point was just over 13{ miles southeast of Shakespeare Cliff, the British terminus near the town of Dover, and 10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte, near Calais.
French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British counterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials.

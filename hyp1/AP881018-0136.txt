Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across the open Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall.
There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or missing in a town in Colombia the day before.
``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.
In Colombia, an official of the state of Bolivar in the northern part of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the town of Carmen de Bolivar, about 360 miles north of the capital of Bogota.

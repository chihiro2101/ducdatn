'They'd sell off bits of the White House lawn for a vote if they could' - Jim Jontz, head of the Fair Trade Campaign against Nafta '
It's one president, all the living former presidents, 41 governors, 14 Nobel Laureates and 284 economists versus Perot, Buchanan and Brown; it's your choice' - Mickey Kantor, US trade representative
, the latest addition to the matriarchy of all political battles will be finally decided on November 17 when 258 Democrats, 175 Republicans, and one independent in the 435-member House of Representatives (there is one vacant seat) vote on whether to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement linking the US, Mexico and Canada on January 1.
The stakes are enormous - for the political credibility of President Bill Clinton early in his term and for the legacy of President Carlos Salinas as he nears the end of his, for the evolution of the Mexican and US economies, and for a global trading structure in which a Uruguay Round agreement scheduled to be reached by December 15 may be unattainable if Nafta goes down.
Conventional party lines are irrelevant in the intense retail political war now going on in pursuit of the 218-vote nirvana.
More Republicans, perhaps as many as 120 according to congressman Jim Kolbe of Arizona, far fewer according to Mr Jim Jontz, a former congressman from Indiana, will vote for than against, not least because the original Nafta was negotiated by the Bush administration.
For the Democratic coalition that just - by one vote - sustained the president in the great budget battle against unanimous Republican opposition, is in tatters.
In July it was the 'new' Democrats, especially moderates from the south, who deserted Mr Clinton while the old liners - labour, liberals, blacks - held their noses and held fast.
Democrat John Dingell of Michigan came out for the 'noes' this week, but Mr Daley counters that he could never understand why anybody thought he would do anything different.
Ms Wallach, who portrays the Nafta divide as one between 'populists and the elites', says there is little top-level contact with Mr Perot, who first spoke of the 'giant sucking sound' of US jobs going south to Mexico, but that his troops offer access to conservatives and small businesses.
She points out that Congressman Kweisi Mfume from Maryland, leader of the 38-strong black Democratic caucus previously so loyal to Mr Clinton, is helping Mr Bonior garner votes against Nafta, and that only one black congressman has come out in favour.

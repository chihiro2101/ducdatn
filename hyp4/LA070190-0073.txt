Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982.
"It was like meeting my lover," he says.
"Since then, my passion really went up," said Fujita, a professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms.
Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago creating tornadoes for research.
He creates tornadoes over a large fan, which makes a swirling motion; another fan above simulates a low-pressure system by adding an updraft to the mix.
Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are so many tornadoes in this country.
"Tornadoes are very rare in Japan," Fujita said.
The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts, a term coined by Fujita, as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the last 15 years, causing 577 fatalities.

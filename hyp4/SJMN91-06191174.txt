It's a coincidence of cosmic proportions.
But the sun also happens to be about 400 times as far away from Earth as the moon.
And when the moon's orbit happens to carry it directly across the face of the sun, as it will Thursday, the effect is stunning -- a total solar eclipse.
"It's maybe the greatest natural occurrence one can witness," said Larry Toy, a Chabot College astronomy professor.
(This line-up would occur at every new moon, except that the moon's orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun's path every six months.)
In the United States, the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of decades -- along the East Coast in 1970 and across the Northwest and Northern Plains in 1979.
"It's going to be great from up there on the mountain," said Harold Zirin, a California Institute of Technology astronomer who will be at one of the observatories atop Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that makes up a large piece of the island of Hawaii.
(The Keck Observatory, being built by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, is behind its original construction schedule and will not be completed in time for the eclipse.)

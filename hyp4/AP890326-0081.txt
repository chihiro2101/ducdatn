Alaska's governor, meanwhile, declared once-pristine
Prince William Sound a disaster area as the toll on the waterway's abundant wildlife began to mount.
The Coast Guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles.
As clean-up efforts continued Sunday, fishermen fearing lost income sought compensation Sunday.
Exxon Shipping Co. held a meeting Sunday between fishermen and a company claims officer.
The Coast Guard said it ordered the closure to prevent pollution from being carried to Valdez on vessels passing through the oil.

``This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit Alaska since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago,''
The transfer of oil remaining aboard the Exxon Valdez to the Exxon Baton Rouge resumed late Saturday.
By late Sunday, Exxon officials said a total of 37,500 barrels of oil had been transferred in the first two days of the operation, leaving more than 900,000 barrels on the ship.
An experiment to assess the possibility of burning off the oil was completed early Sunday and the Coast Guard said Exxon officials were ``cautiously optimistic.''
Environmentalists, the governor and other top state officials have accused Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. of responding too slowly to the spill.
Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said Exxon has reviewed information gathered by divers and determined there are five holes in the vessel's hull on the starboard side.

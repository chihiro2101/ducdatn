THE CONDITION known in cattle as 'mad cow disease', spongiform encephalopathies, has been found in Britain's sparsely-scattered antelope population, the government has admitted.
Three elands, three greater kudu and an arabian oryx have been diagnosed with the disease over the past three years.
The statistics - released in response to a written question from Mr Ron Davies, a Labour agriculture spokesman - show a disconcertingly rapid increase in the number of sheep found to have the disease.
Mr David Maclean, junior agriculture minister, stressed that naturally occurring spongiform encephalopathies in species other than cattle were not notifiable diseases.

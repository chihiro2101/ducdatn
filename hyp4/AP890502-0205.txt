Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost on Tuesday attacked Exxon's plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill.
Consumers, politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger in a one-day ``Boycott Exxon'' campaign.
Yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster, said Exxon's plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics.
In Washington, consumer activist Ralph Nader said Exxon ``should not be allowed to forget''
He and others blasted Exxon for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled hundreds of miles of Alaska's coast.
They also questioned subsequent increases in gas prices.
``We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that doesn't understand its responsibility to protect the environment,''
J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State Gasoline Retailers Association in Billerica, Mass., said it was too early to assess the boycott's impact.
However, he said the cleanup, to be paid for by the oil industry, could add $100 million to $500 million to Alaska's economy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing industry.
Exxon President William D. Stevens said the company was ``turning heaven and Earth to set things right.''

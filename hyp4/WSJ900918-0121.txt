Friday nights used to be slow at The Fault Line, a nightclub here on busy Poplar Avenue.
But after word spread that a major earthquake was forecast for Dec. 3 in the Midwest, The Fault Line began throwing earthquake parties.
On Friday nights now, hundreds of patrons pour into the club to swig "Earthquake shooters" and sign up to win Dec. 3 Earthquake Escape Packages to the Bahamas or Hot Springs, Ark.
But even as Memphians whoop it up, the prediction that the Big One may come in December is triggering tremors up and down the Mississippi Valley.
Shaken, thousands of people are crowding into earthquake survival classes.
In Arnold, Mo., 3,000 people showed up for one course.
In Missouri and Arkansas, some schools and businesses have announced plans to close in early December.
"You can't run from everything," says Tammy McCormick, a nurse in Blytheville, Ark., who will take her two youngsters and spend several days with relatives in North Carolina.
In 1811 and 1812, along a 120-mile zig-zag formation called the New Madrid fault, a series of quakes ravaged the Midwest.
The New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) fault still has 150 small, mostly unfelt, earthquakes a year.
"We're overdue for one in the 6s and low 7s," says David Stewart, an earthquake expert at Southeast Missouri State University.
Since 1971, Mr. Browning says, he has picked the correct dates of four large earthquakes, two volcanoes -- and one day with both a volcano and an earthquake.
The New Madrid area has a 50-50 chance of producing at least a 7 quake on Dec. 3, give or take a day or two on either side, Mr. Browning says.
No responsible scientist can predict an exact day for an earthquake," says Brian Mitchell, a quake expert at St. Louis University, echoing the majority opinion.
But Mr. Browning shouldn't be written off so quickly, says Southeast Missouri State's Mr. Stewart, who recently spent four days with Mr. Browning.

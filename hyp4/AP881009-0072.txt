Johnson _ stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol _ also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last summer in Rome, the Toronto Star newspaper quoted Ms. Issajenko as saying.
Ms. Issajenko, who also competed in the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, was quoted as saying she also took the muscle-building drug.
Later, her husband Tony said Ms. Issajenko denied saying she and Johnson took steroids.
Ms. Issajenko in the interview claimed Dr. George Mario (Jamie) Astaphan provided steroids and monitored the program with the knowledge of Charlie Francis, coach of the Mazda Optimist Track Club, which she and Johnson belong to.

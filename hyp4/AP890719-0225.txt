Simply put, the question was who should be counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not.
That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional reapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and politically charged.
The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census.
Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the redistricting process.
Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said it was unconstitutional, as well as unworkable.
``The framers of the Constitution intended to count all persons,'' Kennedy said.
But Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said the people who wrote the documents had no concept of illegal aliens because there weren't any in their time.
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the question should be put squarely to the Supreme Court.

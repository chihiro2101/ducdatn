Workmen tunneling under the English Channel have created the first land link between Britain and the Continent, connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of engineering and finance.
TransManche Link, the construction consortium building the ``Chunnel'' said the historic linkup occurred at 8:25 p.m. Tuesday when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to their French colleagues.
Linking England and France, the tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe.
Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium overseeing the world's largest engineering project, plans for high-speed trains to pass through the Channel Tunnel in June 1993.
Eventually a train trip from Paris to London should take three hours.
Despite her countrymen's fears of losing their ancient moat against Europe, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described the breakthrough as ``a very exciting moment.''
In London, the conservative Daily Express newspaper noted today that Britons will be able to walk to France for the first time since the Ice Age.
Champagne corks popped and workers danced jigs after French drillers phoned news of the probe's arrival to their British counterparts.
The tunnels were joined 13{ miles southeast of Folkestone, England, the British terminus near Dover, and 10 miles northwest of Sangatte, near Calais.

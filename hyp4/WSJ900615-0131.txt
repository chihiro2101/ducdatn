A shadow is falling across the light at the British end of the Channel Tunnel.
Just as prospects brighten for the beleaguered "chunnel," Britain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel link.
The Thatcher government's announcement yesterday that it wouldn't help fund a high-speed rail link between London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the country's creaky transportation system will isolate Britain on the periphery of Europe.
Sarah Talbot-Williams, a spokeswoman for the Confederation of British Industry, Britain's main employers' group says, "1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market.
"There will be no more talk of crisis," says Alastair Morton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the consortium building the cross-channel link.
But the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel's total benefits.
European Rail Link Ltd., a consortium formed last November to build the rail link, had asked the government to contribute #350 million towards the total #2.6 billion cost of the link.

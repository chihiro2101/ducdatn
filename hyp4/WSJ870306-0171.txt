Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is floundering, and the international tin cartel has collapsed.
But De Beers not only halted a fall in rough-diamond prices, it raised them an average 14.5% last year.
Sales still soared 40% to a near-record $2.56 billion, double the $1.26 billion posted in the 1982 doldrums.
De Beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable. "
Selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers; helping them to sell more is ours," says Stephen Lussier, a De Beers marketing executive.
De Beers helped with an advertising and promotion budget that swelled to $110 million this year, up from $43 million in 1980.
The promotional budget covers market research, a world-wide network of as many as 200 public-relations officials, and advertising campaigns coordinated by the agencies N.W. Ayer &amp; Son in the U.S. and J. Walter Thompson Co. in 27 other countries.
"diamond image" advertising aims at perpetuating the mystique of quality diamonds as "the ultimate expression of love," he says.
De Beers's Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York.
"De Beers can't stop evolution," says Jack Lunzer, chairman of IDC Holdings Ltd., a London-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for Guinea, an African nation that isn't a cartel member.

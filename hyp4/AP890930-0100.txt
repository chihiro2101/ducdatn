Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late father, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years before his death in 1976.
Some black politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not doing enough to stop it.
``There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white leadership in this city to end racism,'' said Bob Starks, associate professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois University.
Daley is filling the remaining two years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he died in November 1987.

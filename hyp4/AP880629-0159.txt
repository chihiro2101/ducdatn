Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets crashed in the air today and exploded, an air force spokeswoman said.
The accident occurred less than two hours after another F-16 crashed into the Black Forest.
She said the aircraft, assigned to the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn Air Base, crashed at 1:30 p.m.
Ms. Hayes told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from U.S. Air Force European headquarters at Ramstein Air Base.

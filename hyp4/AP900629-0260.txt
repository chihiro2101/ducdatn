It's been described as the largest current civil engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.
The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug and scheduled to open on time in three years.
But the three-tunnel thoroughfare under the English Channel is almost 60 percent over budget, embroiled in a contractor dispute and scrambling for more investment money.
While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail is dragging.
The British resisted an undersea bond with the continent envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French engineer named Albert Mathieu.
The Chunnel project also has been marred by eight accidental deaths on the site.
Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: ``We always made it very clear that this was a risk project.''
Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the first year.
The French government, on the contrary, is spending roughly $2.8 billion building 210 miles of rail from Paris to the tunnel, with a branch to Brussels, where the EC is headquartered.

Third World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the United States and other creditors last year than they received in new loans -- a major drain on their already cash-strapped economies -- the World Bank reported Sunday.
The figure, contained in the bank's annual report and made public before its annual meeting here Sept. 23, was almost a third larger than in 1987, when the net pay-back totaled $38.3 billion.
The bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to Third World countries to about $16.4 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988.
The figures on the cash drain showed that these "net resource transfers," as the bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the mounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on Third World economies.
The bank said the continuing deterioration in the debt situation underscores the need for further efforts by the industrial countries to help Third World governments pare back their debt -- a major aim of the U.S. plan offered by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.

Foreigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the winners weren't Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz.
Douglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, was the overall winner and Poland's Wanda Panfil, who lives in Mexico, was the women's winner in Sunday's race which was plagued by heat and humidity.
Ikangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record time, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their respective divisions.
Since Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no American has won the women's division.

President Reagan warned Saturday that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that does not contain a work requirement.
``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president said in a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20 miles north of here.
Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, said that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he said such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare officials, not the federal government.
The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6 percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3 per cent, which was a 14-year low.

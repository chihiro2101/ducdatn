The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper Midwest _ perhaps nowhere harder than in North Dakota.
More disaster relief aid went there than to any other state.
The third story in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,'' examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers most in need.
Carl Grindberg survived the drought with a $45,000 dose of federal aid.
But for this farmer and others, it was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it away with the other.
The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent state.
The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many say it also kept the state afloat.
`If it hadn't been for drought aid, the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been disastrous.
``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,''
But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid, including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land and may have prevented some business closures.
``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg, another farmer in this Red River Valley county.
But drought aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North Dakota State University study found.
Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been just $6,300.
``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist.

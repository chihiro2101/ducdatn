Public officials throughout California have condemned a U.S. Senate vote Thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census, saying the action will shortchange California in Congress and possibly deprive the state of millions of dollars of federal aid for medical emergency services and other programs for poor people.
At the same time, the Senate's action has created great confusion and stirred hopes, especially among urban Democrats, that it will be overturned by the House of Representatives.
If it becomes law, the Senate's action could have a major impact on California and other states where the influx of illegal aliens significantly boosts the population and, thus, can affect the size of congressional delegations and the amount of federal aid that is doled out.
Authorities on reapportionment have widely predicted that California would gain five to seven congressional seats as a result of population gains made during the last decade.
Jesse R. Huff, the state's financial director, said the state could lose as much as $300 million in federal aid that is allocated on the basis of population as determined by census counts.
Los Angeles County officials said the measure could cut off federal funds for emergency medical services for illegal aliens.
In the past, about $80 million annually in such services for illegal aliens has been paid out, with about half of that amount paid in Los Angeles County, according to Mark Tajima, a legislative analyst employed by the county's chief administrative officer.

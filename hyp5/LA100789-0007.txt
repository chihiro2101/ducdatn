Second Amendment states (1791): "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
The Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill of Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from the federal government.
The Second Amendment stated one of the subjects about which the federal government was prohibited from making any laws.
There have been lower federal court decisions regarding the Second Amendment, all supportive of this established principle.

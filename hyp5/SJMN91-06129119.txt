CONSIDER THE following case:
A suspect involved in a high-speed chase refuses to stop.
At the end of the chase the officer takes his baton and brutally hits the suspect on the back eight to 10 times, then kicks him in the face.
The suspect, unconscious, is taken to Valley Medical Center where he is found to have a dislocated shoulder, a concussion, and numerous cuts, bruises and contusions.
This was a real case involving a Santa Clara County police agency.
One sergeant reported that the suspect kept trying to move around and had to be told to remain lying down.
Unfortunately, MacNamara also believes that San Jose does not need a citizens' review board.
I agree with Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado's suggestion and the San Jose City Council's decision to create a system where a city official will receive and track citizen complaints about the police.
Police accountability includes the right of the public to review records of investigations of complaints.

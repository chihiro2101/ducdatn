Shining Path guerrillas, who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago, are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose.
Abimael Guzman, founder of the rebel movement, has said of the slums and their people: ``The immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his reactionary forces.''
His Maoist rebels, once secretive fanatics, are becoming a political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two-thirds of Lima's 7 million people scrape along.
Their huts built of straw mats line the bone-dry slopes of the Andean foothills 15 miles east of downtown Lima.
They make ideal recruits for the Shining Path _ Sendero Luminoso in Spanish.
Shining Path's move into a more public role, and through most of Peru from its Andean base in Ayacucho province, has coincided with economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2,000 percent.
The most striking development of the last 18 months has been the Shining Path's move into public view in this grimy capital on South America's Pacific coast.
Analysts and experts on counterinsurgency say Shining Path appears bent on dominating the radical left of legal politics.
Guzman, a Marxist philosophy professor, founded Sendero Luminoso in 1970 in Ayacucho, an Andean state capital 230 miles southeast of Lima where he had built a following at the University of Huamanga.
Shining Path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood associations in the Lima slums this year, says a confidential Interior Ministry report obtained by The Associated Press.

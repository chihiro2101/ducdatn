A United Airlines Boeing 737-200 jetliner carrying 25 passengers and crew members crashed into a dry lake area near Colorado Springs, Colo., municipal airport, apparently killing all aboard.
As National Transportation Safety Board investigators hurried to the scene, there weren't any early indications on why the jet might have crashed.
One focus of the inquiry, however, is expected to center on whether there were unstable or gusty winds at the time of the crash.
The plane hit the ground several miles south of the airport at about 11:40 a.m. EST yesterday, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said.
In July 1988, a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, after an engine broke apart in flight, killing 112 people.
About two hours before yesterday's crash, the National Weather Service in Colorado Springs issued its first high wind warning for the area since January, according to James Hall, a meteorological technician observer in Colorado Springs.
The last major U.S. wind shear accident occurred in Dallas in 1985, when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on approach.

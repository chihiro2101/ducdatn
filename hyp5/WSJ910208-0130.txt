In response to Michael Gartner's Viewpoint "Tell Me a Good Reason for Handguns" (Jan. 10, op-ed page): Mr. Gartner conveniently omits many pertinent facts concerning the use and abuse of guns in America.
Based on Justice Department victimization surveys, felon surveys, the National Association of Chiefs of Police law-enforcement survey, Promis studies, research by the Rand Corp., and by criminology researchers James D. Wright
-- More than 99.6% of U.S. handguns will not be involved in criminal activity in any given year.
-- More than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type of firearm, while more than 70% oppose "waiting periods" for the same reason.
found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for using a gun as an important reason for not arming themselves.
-- Gary Kleck found that using a gun for protection from violent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces the likelihood that the crime will be completed and that intended victims will be injured.
According to Mr. Gartner, "this year about 3,000 teen-agers . . . will use handguns to kill themselves.
As a life member of the National Rifle Association, I agree with Mr. Gartner -- it is not too much to ask for a nationwide "seven-day `cooling-off' period" (the Brady Bill) to give the authorities time for background checks.

What kind of justice would Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Thurgood Marshall, be?
In a series of interviews with me a few weeks prior to his nomination, Mr. Thomas echoed themes that run through his articles and speeches over the past decade.
-- "I don't believe in quotas.
America was founded on a philosophy of individual rights, not group rights.
The civil rights movement was at its greatest when it proclaimed the highest principles on which this country was founded -- principles such as the Declaration of Independence which were betrayed in the case of blacks and other minorities."
-- "I believe that society is now in a position to vigorously enforce equal rights for all Americans. . . .
-- "America should not fall into the trap of blaming all the problems faced by blacks or other minorities on others.
When I hear a case, I know damn well that something is going to happen as a result of what I decide.
But in fact, a careful reading of his articles and speeches reveals a different sort of judicial conservatism.
Mr. Thomas is likely to be a very different kind of judge from the man he is replacing.
It is here, under the stern tutelage of his grandfather, Myers Anderson, that Mr. Thomas locates the beginning of his true education.
As Mr. Thomas remembers, his grandfather believed that "Man ain't got no business on relief as long as he can work.
These lessons of hard work, personal dignity and self-sufficiency were reinforced through years of Catholic school and college.
"Thomas came in, and he rejected all that," remarks William Robinson, dean of the District of Columbia School of Law.
When he was nominated to the D.C. Circuit in late 1989, a number of these special interest groups prepared for a bloodbath.
Can Clarence Thomas be confirmed to the Supreme Court?
Dean Robinson added, "People often confuse what Clarence thinks with what some of his friends on the right think, but Clarence is his own man."

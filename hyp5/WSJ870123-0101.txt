In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families.
Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty.
If the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is.
To build on the momentum he created a year ago, the president must make plain his commitment in the State of the Union message next Tuesday.

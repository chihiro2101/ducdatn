The names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of Hugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the future.
"The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s," says meteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University, who analyzes hurricane patterns.
Rainfall in the Sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricane activity, was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969, he says.
Last year's Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and the Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere.
This September's Hugo, which ripped through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before clobbering South Carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an atmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches).
In this century, only two No. 5 hurricanes have struck the United States with full force, the 1935 Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys and 1969's Camille, which slammed ashore at Mississippi and Louisiana.

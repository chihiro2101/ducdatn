There is a recurring temptation in American politics to wreak vengeance on one's adversaries by overhauling the political institutions that they dominate.
What usually results from this ill-considered radical surgery is that the very people who scheduled the operations end up in the recovery room.
Franklin D. Roosevelt's plan to expand the Supreme Court in 1937 to dilute the votes of conservatives resulted in the creation of an opposing political coalition that lived on after the controversy to plague every subsequent Democratic President.
The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would never be another F.D.R., so they pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms.
The first President to come under the restriction was Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican who might very well have won a third term.
By itself, the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act of vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar measures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado.

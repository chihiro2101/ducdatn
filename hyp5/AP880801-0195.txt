Carbon particles indicate the exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit.
``You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson,'' said Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain National Forest.
and he and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames.
Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood said.
On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in Missouri are deliberately set.
He said Mark Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem.
Smallwood's job includes investigating marijuana growing in the forest, timber theft and theft of other federal property.
His military-neat office at the Forest Service headquarters in Rolla is decorated with game bird feathers, a picture of Smokey Bear and a glass-doored bookcase lined with reports and text books.

``We had one case (in 1984) where two men went to Sunday school and after school they started a fire with their Sunday school literature,''
Last year, a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the Forest Service.

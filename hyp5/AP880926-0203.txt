Third World countries led by Brazil, the world's most indebted developing nation, blamed the industrialized nations in part Monday for perpetuating their poverty.
Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreau Sodre of Brazil told the opening session of the 42nd General Assembly that the Third World economic picture was dimming ``due to the lack of progress in international economic relations.''
A similar theme sounded Monday in West Berlin, where finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded ``more forceful action'' to help Third World countries repay $1.2 trillion in debts.
Officials of the seven key industrialized nations in the non-communist realm _ the United States, West Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Italy and Britain _ have approved a plan to aid the world's poorest nations, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.

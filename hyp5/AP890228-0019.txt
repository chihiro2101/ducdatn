The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around the world, the Survey reported Monday.
Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about 10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost.
In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale.
The death toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets.
Last year's second most deadly earthquake occurred Aug. 20 on the Nepal-India border, killing 1,000.
That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many people.

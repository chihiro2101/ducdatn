US INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in Florida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced.
The figure is the first official tally of the damage resulting from the hurricane, which ripped through southern Florida last week.
President George Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region since the hurricane hit.
Although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of insurance claims, yesterday's figure comes from the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Services Group, the property-casualty insurers' trade association.
